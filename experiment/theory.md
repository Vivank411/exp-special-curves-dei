### Theory-

The curves that are obtained by a fixed point in the circumference of a circle when it rolls along a specified straight or curved path are called special curves.  

### Cycloid- 
A curve that is formed when a point situated on the circumference of a circle rolls along a straight path without slipping is known as a cycloid.

### Epicycloid- 
A curve that is formed by a point situated on the circumference of the circle that rolls on another circle outside it without slipping is known as an epicycloid

### Hypocycloid-
curve that is formed by a point situated on the circumference of the circle that rolls inside another circle is known as a hypocycloid.  

Cycloidal curves have wide range of practical applications such as in the designing of gear tooth profiles, in foundries they are used in conveyor boxes, in designing a rollercoaster ,etc. Special curves are employed in designing cam profiles for machinery that require specific motions, such as translating or oscillating movements.
Engineers use special curves to model and analyze the stress distribution in complex structures, ensuring their stability and safety.
